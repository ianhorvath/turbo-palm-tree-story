	There is a man named Jack. Jack is a completely ordinary person. There is nothing strange about him at all. He arrives at work in an accounting firm at 9:00 A.M. sharp every morning
Monday-Friday and he leaves at 5:00 P.M. sharp at the end of every day. One Saturday, Jack woke up a bit early to watch the news. All of the headlines were completely ordinary. The least ordinary
of them was, "man slipped on ice and died after morning coffee." This wasn't ordinary because normally this wouldn't be newsworthy. After the news is over, Jack finished his morning coffee and
went outside. Although there was still some ice out, Jack wanted to go for a brisk Saturday morning walk, like an ordinary person.

Then that Saturday became special for him. On his way of the walk, he met a beautiful girl and gave her his number. After that he want back to home happily.
